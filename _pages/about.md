Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am currently a research assistant working with Prof. [Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). Previously, I was an undergraduate at ShanghaiTech University graduated in 2023, and spent one year at MIT where I worked with Prof. [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/). My research interests mainly lie in natural language processing and machine learning. 

In the long term, I want to align artificial intelligence with natural intelligence. I am taking my initial steps to incorporate structural bias (e.g., compositionality) into models and hope to make current large language models more sample-efficient, generalizable, and interpretable.

As a junior researcher, I broadly enjoy any work that expands/deepens my understanding, and due to my Breadth-First-Search-like background during my earlier undergraduate study, I am excited at all the works that connect existing fields.


<!-- What I have been doing:
* Structures Between Words: Grammar Induction, Multi-grained Representation Learning
* Structures Within Words: Tokenization that aligns better to morphology
* Learning from mistakes: Reward-conditioned Sequence Generation -->
