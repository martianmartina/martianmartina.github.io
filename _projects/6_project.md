# My class project for class Interactive Music Systems in 2022. 

# Check our fun demo [here](https://musictech.mit.edu/blog/sing-go-hero)

# This project originates from my nascent idea in hope to marry karaoke and platformer game to bring laughter. My first plan was to ask the player guess and sing the right pitch based on the height of the coins on the screen (higher the coin, higher the pitch should be) and the coin layout is according to the pitch of a song that the player has no idea of. Later my teammates and I have to admit that this "random melody you donâ€™t know" feature may not be tenable.
